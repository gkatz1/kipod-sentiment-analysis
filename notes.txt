TODO:
1. Embedding - load GloVe vectors
2. Data loading & processing
3. Batch generator
4. Params ("tuning" - basically, start with choosing values that make sense)
5. Add evaluation during training
6. Save best model + params


etc:
1. Overfitting? Early stopping!


Resources:
1. Code - (a) https://github.com/adeshpande3/LSTM-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/master/Oriole%20LSTM.ipynb (Used some of it)
	  (b) https://www.kaggle.com/parth05rohilla/sentiment-analysis-using-7-different-techniques/notebook

2. Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/ynouri/rotten-tomatoes-sentiment-analysis/data


Notes:
1. Data is biased (class counts: class 2 with 79,582 sentences, class 0 with 7072 sentences)

Questions:
1. Padding - should we pad to the longest sentence? Maybe better to use only e.g. 80%
   of the data while cutting the length of the longest sentence by 50%
